A portfolio website is one of the most useful things you can build as a developer. It's not only great coding practice, but building one also allows you show your work to employers and the development community.

In this project, you'll build your own portfolio site using one of the hottest web technologies out there: React!

This site you'll build will show images of the projects you've worked on, some details about your story, and your contact information.

Technical details

The technologies you'll use in this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and of course: React. There is no site back-end necessary.

You will use a library called React Router in order to create a single-page app. A single-page app has content that is loaded inline but still behaves like a "normal" web page. This means that when the user clicks on a button, like a link to your "About" page, the URL in their address bar should still change despite the fact that the page doesn't appear to refresh entirely. Content is loaded inline, which provides a smooth and seamless user experience!

In order to install React Router, you'll need to run:

npm install â€”save react-router-dom

-dom  is appended to the command because you're building an app that will run in the browser.

Full documentation for React Router is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router
Design

It's up to you to design a portfolio site that best communicates your personality and preferred visual aesthetic. You might prefer a minimalist design, or you might want a site with a lot of elements and information. It's your choice! Just make sure you can justify the design choices you make because if you decide to take your site live, it'll be your business card online. Make sure it's in harmony with who you are!

Include images of your work if possible in order to truly communicate what you can do. 

Content

You must have the following pages:

  - A homepage that features your name and a small greeting. This greeting can be in your own voice (ex. "Welcome to my website! I'm a developer, designer, and dog-lover"), or it can be third-person explanatory. Whatever you like. You simply want to grab people's attention!
  - An about page that features information about your educational experience (you can cite OpenClassrooms!) and your work history if you have some. You can write paragraphs or present your information in a list form. If you want to include other information about yourself, feel free.
  - A contact page that lets people know the best way to get in touch with you. You can build a functional contact form or simply display your email address and social media links.
    Other pages may also be included but are optional.

Hosting

The project can be hosted at a domain name of your choice or can simply be a set of local files on your computer that you share with your mentor if you don't want the site to be live or public.



Do not copy these examples! Your site should reflect your own personality, design, and technology choices. Copies of existing work will not be valid for credit.
Deliverables

    Code files for your portfolio site
    Optional: a link to the portfolio site live on the web

For your deliverables to be processed by the jury, upload all project deliverables onto the platform in a folder named "P4_first_name". Each deliverable must be named with the project number and in the order in which it appears, e.g. "P4_01_codefiles", "P4_02_portfoliosite" etc. 
Presentation

You'll do an oral presentation of your project with an assessor in order to simulate real-life conditions.

The presentation will be structured as follows:

    Presentation of your portfolio site, design choices, and technical process: 15-20 minutes
    Q&A: 10 minutes
